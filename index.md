<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Telecommunications Engineering at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to work with and be advised by [Prof. Wenping Ma](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/mawenping/). I am interested in resource management and security privacy in future 6G networks. Specifically, I focus on communication and network resource management and sharing, blockchain-based network management. I also have a strong passion for security and privacy in distributed networks.
