<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Telecommunications Engineering at <a href="https://www.xidian.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xidian University</a>. I was fortunate to work with and be advised by <a href="https://web.xidian.edu.cn/mawenping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Wenping Ma</a>. I am interested in resource management and security privacy in future 6G networks. Specifically, I focus on communication and network resource management and sharing, blockchain-based network management. I also have a strong passion for security and privacy in distributed networks.
