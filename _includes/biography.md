I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Telecommunications Engineering at <a href="https://www.xidian.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xidian University</a>. I was fortunate to work with and be advised by <a href="https://web.xidian.edu.cn/mawenping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Wenping Ma</a>.
